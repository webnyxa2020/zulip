Administrators may enable the option to create **web-public streams**.
Web-public streams can be viewed by anyone on the Internet without
creating an account in your organization.

For example, you can [link to a Zulip
topic](/help/link-to-a-message-or-conversation) in a web-public stream
from a GitHub issue, a social media post, or a forum thread, and
anyone will be able to click the link and view the discussion in the
Zulip web application without needing to create an account.

Users who wish to post content will need to create an account in order
to do so.
